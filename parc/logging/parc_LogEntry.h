/**
 * @file parc_LogEntry.h
 * @brief Basic Log Entry implementation
 *
 * PARCLogEntry instances contain logging information in a single message.
 *
 * Each instance contains:
 * * A log level (see PARCLogLevel).
 * * An integer version number denoting the version of the syslog protocol specification (1).
 * * A timestamp representable as an RFC 3339 Timestamp.
 * * A hostname identifing the machine that originally sent the message.
 * * An application name identifing the device or application that originated the message.
 * * A process identifier having specific meaning,
 *    except that a change in the value indicates there has been a discontinuity in a series of
 *    otherwise linear PARCLogEntry instances.
 * * A message identifier as a string without further semantics other than identifing the type of message.
