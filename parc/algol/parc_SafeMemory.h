 *
 * @brief Facade to memory functions to make calls safer.
 *
 * This is a facade to interpose between an application and the standard C library functions posix_memalign(3),
 * malloc(3), calloc(3), realloc(3) and free(3) that establishes detectable boundaries around an allocated memory segment,
 * records a stack backtrace for each allocation,
 * detects buffer overruns and underruns by checking the boundaries when the memory is deallocated,
 * and tries to prevent a stray pointer to reference the memory again once it's been deallocated.
 *
 * The allocated memory consists of three contiguous segments: the prefix, the memory usable by the caller, and the suffix.
 * The memory usable by the caller is aligned as specified by the caller.
 * The alignment must be a power of 2 greater than or equal to the size of a {@code void *}.
 * <pre>
 * +--base  +-prefix     +-- aligned memory   +-- suffix aligned on (void *)
 * v        v            v                    v
 * |________|PPPPPPPPPPPP|mmmmmmmmm...mmmm|___|SSSSSSSSS
 *                                         ^
 *                                         +-- variable padding
 * </pre>
 * Where '-' indicates padding, 'P' indicates the prefix data structure, 'm'
 * indicates contiguous memory for use by the caller, and 'S" indicates the suffix data structure.
 *
 * To enable this facade, you must include the following line in your execution before any allocations are performed.
 *
 * @code
 * {
 *     parcMemory_SetInterface(&PARCSafeMemoryAsPARCMemory);
 * }
