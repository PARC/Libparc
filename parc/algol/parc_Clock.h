 * @file parc_Clock.h
 * @ingroup datastructures
 * @brief Generic API to a clock
 *
 * Interface over clock providers.  We provide two system clocks, a Wallclock that tracks the
 * real time clock and a monotonic clock that will not skew or go backwards.
 * @see parcClock_Monotonic()
 * and
 * @see parcClock_Wallclock()
 * Also provided is a counting clock.
 * @see parcClock_Counter()
 *
 * Below is a complete example of a simple custom clock that implements an atomic counter for
 * the time.  Each call to getTime or getTimeval will increment the counter.  This clock is
 * available as parcClock_Counter().
 *
 * @code
 *   typedef struct counter_clock {
 *      uint64_t counter;
 *   } _CounterClock;
 *
 *   parcObject_ExtendPARCObject(_CounterClock, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL);
 *   static parcObject_ImplementAcquire(_counterClock, _CounterClock);
 *
 *   static PARCClock *
 *   _counterClock_AcquireInterface(const PARCClock *clock)
 *   {
 *      _CounterClock *cc = (_CounterClock *) clock->closure;
 *      _counterClock_Acquire(cc);
 *      return (PARCClock *) clock;
 *   }
 *
 *   static void
 *   _counterClock_ReleaseInterface(PARCClock **clockPtr)
 *   {
 *      PARCClock *clock = *clockPtr;
 *      _CounterClock *cc = (_CounterClock *) clock->closure;
 *
 *      PARCReferenceCount refcount = parcObject_Release((void **) &cc);
 *      if (refcount == 0) {
 *         parcMemory_Deallocate((void **) clockPtr);
 *      } else {
 *         *clockPtr = NULL;
 *      }
 *   }
 *
 *   static void
 *   _counterClock_GetTimeval(const PARCClock *clock, struct timeval *output)
 *   {
 *      _CounterClock *cc = (_CounterClock *) clock->closure;
 *      uint64_t value = parcAtomicInteger_Uint64Increment(&cc->counter);
 *      // put 19 bits in the micro-seconds so it is never larger than 1E+6
 *      output->tv_sec = value >> 19;
 *      output->tv_usec = value & 0x7FFFF;
 *   }
 *
 *   static uint64_t
 *   _counterClock_GetTime(const PARCClock *clock)
 *   {
 *      _CounterClock *cc = (_CounterClock *) clock->closure;
 *      return parcAtomicInteger_Uint64Increment(&cc->counter);
 *   }
 *
 *   PARCClock *
 *   parcClock_Counter(void)
 *   {
 *      _CounterClock *cc = parcObject_CreateInstance(_CounterClock);
 *      cc->counter = 0;
 *
 *      PARCClock *clock = parcMemory_Allocate(sizeof(PARCClock));
 *      clock->closure = cc;
 *      clock->acquire = _counterClock_AcquireInterface;
 *      clock->release = _counterClock_ReleaseInterface;
 *      clock->getTime = _counterClock_GetTime;
 *      clock->getTimeval = _counterClock_GetTimeval;
 *      return clock;
 *   }
